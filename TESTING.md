## Validation Services ##

Additionally, all code was validated in the following ways:

HTML - All pages were successfully run through the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to ensure compliance with the standards set by the W3C.

CSS - CSS validation with the [W3C Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) returned some expected and necessary flags from vendor extensions. Other than that, the code complies to the W3C standards.

Python - All Python code was checked with the [PEP8 online validator](http://pep8online.com/) and is PEP8 compliant, aside from line length flags, which were left for code readability.

JavaScript - All files were tested with [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) validators.
